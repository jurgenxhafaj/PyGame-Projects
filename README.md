# PyGame-Projects
simple game/animations in python using PyGame

The goal of this repository was to dive deeper into PyGame, and try to learn the fundamentals of creating a game using PyGame package
This repository includes scratch work and a semi-finished product of a 'racing game'. 

Please note that this repository is just a work-in-progress and by no means a finished product.
It was the first time I learnt about PyGame, and it helped me get used to it and utilize this package on the first weeks of my Billiards project.
